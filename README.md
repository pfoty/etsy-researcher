# Etsy Research (OpenClaw Skill)

**Etsy Research** is an OpenClaw skill for structured, evidence-based analysis of Etsy niches and products.  
Its purpose is to help users identify **what is most likely to sell well and be profitable on Etsy**, without guesswork, hype, or false certainty.

This skill is designed for **decision support**, not automation. It surfaces market signals, tradeoffs, and risks so the user can make informed business choices.

---

## Why this exists

Many Etsy sellers fail for predictable reasons:

- Choosing saturated niches without realizing it
- Copying top listings without understanding *why* they work
- Underpricing or misjudging margins
- Chasing trends without durability
- Trusting fabricated sales numbers or “gurus”

The Etsy Research skill exists to counter those failures with:
- transparent reasoning
- clearly labeled assumptions
- realistic demand and competition signals
- execution-aware analysis

No promises. No fake metrics. Just informed probability.

---

## Core objective

Help the user grow an Etsy business by identifying:
- niches with real demand
- products buyers consistently purchase
- opportunities where differentiation is possible
- pricing bands that support profitability
- risks that could invalidate the opportunity

---

## What the skill does

### 1. Niche analysis
- Evaluates demand strength using visible Etsy signals (reviews, recency, density)
- Assesses saturation and competitive intensity
- Identifies seasonality and trend risk
- Flags niches dominated by a small number of entrenched sellers

### 2. Product-level research
- Analyzes top-performing listings within a niche
- Breaks down value propositions, positioning, and buyer appeal
- Identifies patterns across successful products
- Distinguishes repeatable success from one-off anomalies

### 3. Demand and competition scoring
Each niche or product angle is evaluated on:
- demand consistency
- competition density
- pricing power
- operational complexity
- execution risk

Scores are **comparative**, not absolute.

### 4. Profitability reasoning
- Estimates realistic price ranges
- Accounts for Etsy fees
- Incorporates production cost assumptions (explicitly labeled)
- Provides margin *ranges*, not single numbers

### 5. Opportunity synthesis
Produces:
- concrete product ideas or angles
- differentiation strategies
- what would likely fail
- who the buyer is
- suggested validation steps before committing inventory or time

---

## What the skill does *not* do

- Does not guarantee sales or profits
- Does not fabricate sales numbers or internal Etsy data
- Does not scrape private or restricted information
- Does not automate listings, pricing, ads, or store actions
- Does not bypass Etsy policies or IP restrictions

All outputs are probabilistic and execution-dependent.

---

## Typical workflow

### Step 1: Define the niche
The user specifies:
- niche or theme
- product type (physical, digital, POD, handmade)
- constraints (price, skills, region, production limits)

If the niche is too broad, the skill narrows it before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Market scan (top-down)
- listing volume
- demand signals
- price distribution
- saturation risk
- seasonality indicators

Output: whether the niche is viable and why.

---

### Step 3: Product deep dive (bottom-up)
- reviews and review velocity
- positioning and messaging
- visuals and perceived quality
- customization and bundling
- buyer expectations

Goal: understand *why* buyers choose these products.

---

### Step 4: Scoring and tradeoffs
- demand vs competition
- margin vs effort
- differentiation vs complexity
- durability vs trend dependence

---

### Step 5: Opportunities and risks
- 3–10 product or positioning ideas
- differentiation requirements
- failure modes
- validation suggestions

---

## Output structure

Each research run includes:

### Niche summary
- definition
- demand outlook
- saturation risk
- seasonality notes

### Winning patterns
- shared traits of successful listings
- pricing norms
- buyer expectations

### Opportunity list
For each idea:
- product concept
- target price range
- competition assessment
- differentiation strategy
- risk notes

### Assumptions & caveats
- inferred vs observed data
- execution dependencies
- areas requiring validation

---

## Guardrails

- **No false precision**  
  No exact sales numbers or claims of insider data.
- **Clear assumptions**  
  All estimates are labeled and bounded.
- **IP awareness**  
  Flags trademark, copyright, and fan-art risks.
- **Research only**  
  No store actions or automation without separate consent.
- **Transparency first**  
  Reasoning is always visible.

## Example usage

**User**
> Research profitable Etsy products in the printable wedding signage niche under $15

**Skill output**
- market overview of printable wedding signage
- identification of high-demand clusters (e.g. bundles vs single signs)
- pricing norms and margin reasoning
- saturation warnings
- 5–7 differentiated product ideas with risks and validation steps

---

## Intended users

- Etsy sellers validating new ideas
- New sellers choosing a first niche
- Existing sellers expanding product lines
- Anyone who wants data-informed decisions instead of guesswork

---

## Design philosophy

This skill treats Etsy success as:
- pattern recognition, not prediction
- probability management, not certainty
- execution-aware strategy, not theory

Good Etsy businesses are built on informed bets.  
This skill exists to make those bets smarter.
